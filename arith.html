            After Pascal’s calculator came the <i> Thomas de Colnar arithmometer</i>, invented by Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar in 1820. It was the first mechanical calculator and the first of its kind to be mass produced thanks to the Industrial Revolution. This calculator was used until the early 20th century and helped to start the mechanical calculator industry. Colnar created his device to assist himself as an insurance worker. The <i>arithmometer </i> could do more complex calculations than Pascal’s calculator, including division. The earliest version of the <i>arithmometer</i> had a ribbon that was pulled to choose numbers for calculations. This was later replaced by a crank for efficiency. There were also two display windows, one for input (three-digit limit) and another for output (six-digit limit), but this was reduced to just one in the second model. There was a separate gear for multiplication. As for other operations, the second version included a lever to switch from addition to subtraction and from multiplication to division. The display limits also changed with five digits for input and ten digits for output. There were two models made in 1858 and 1878, which had a second counting mechanism to make operations faster and added springs to the setting slides to avoid digits from moving by mistake. <i>The arithmometer</i> cost about 300-500 francs, and could take up an entire desktop, making them both expensive and bulky, however over 5,000 were produced and sold. Thomas de Colnar’s <i>arithmometer</i> replaced human calculators with machines. Before this invention, there were specialized jobs for people to do calculations, all with mental math.
