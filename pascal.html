    Blaise Pascal is credited with inventing the first actual calculator. While other mathematical devices like abacuses were used to solve for counting and solving basic addition and subtraction, Pascal’s version actually performed calculations. To understand the significance of Pascal’s impact, we must explain his background. Pascal was a French mathematician but also worked with philosophy and physics. He began to work on his <i>Pascaline calculator</i> at only eighteen years old to help his father, who was also a mathematician. <i>Pascal’s calculator</i> had wheels on it to move numbers and calculate the four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Multiplication and division had to be done through adding or subtracting multiple times. To add numbers, the wheels would be moved clockwise, and to subtract, wheels would be moved counterclockwise. The numbers are stored in an accumulator to be processed and then shows up on the display bar. The sautoir, or centerpiece, is what made it possible for the calculator to carry digits. Some downsides, however, include its size, price, and slow speed. Its’ size was large for a calculator: about the size of a shoebox. This made it difficult to transport. It was also expensive to both produce and buy, and as a result, very few were sold. It was time-consuming to solve problems on the calculator as well. <i>Pascal’s invention</i>, built in 1642 was the first of its kind. This prompted other inventors like Leibnez and Leupold to create their own calculators as well, leading to the creations of more and more advanced systems.
