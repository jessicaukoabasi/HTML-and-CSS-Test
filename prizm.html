            Finally, Casio comes out with the first color graphing calculator in 2010: the <i>Casio Prizm x-CG50</i>. Users can now color-code their graphs and put graphs over fully colored pictures. Colors include black, blue, red, magenta, green, cyan, yellow, and white. These hues show up through LCD displays, which use florescent lamps in the back of the calculator to produce light. 3D technology also allows users to create 3D shapes like cubes and cylinders to find surface areas and volumes. Just like the Casio fx-7000g, it includes a fifty-button keyboard with numbers and signs. Along with this is a main menu that include several features, including spreadsheet-making and conic graphing. On the 216 by 384-pixel graphing screen, users can plot points, make histograms and pie charts for statistics, and integrate equation, along with other functions. Picture Plot on the fx-CG10/20 can lie graphs on top of one of 55 photographs. For example, a student can use a picture of a water fountain to fin the equation of a parabola. The senior sales manager for Casio, Makoto Ori, said that Picture Plot would help users apply their math skills to the real world. The line thickness and style of the graphs can also be changed. User can choose between regular, dashed, or dotted lines and make it thick or thin. Casio Prizm calculators have rechargeable batteries. This also means that the memory of the calculator will not be erased like the Casio fx-7000gâ€™s. The calculator can also be connected to a computer for more storage. Currently, it sells for about $80-$100 in various stores. For the time being, it is the most advanced calculator of its kind.
