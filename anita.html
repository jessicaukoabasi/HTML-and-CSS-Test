                In 1961, the Bell Punch Company in London created the <i>first electronic desktop calculators</i>: the <i>ANITA MK VII and the ANITA MK VIII</i>. ANITA stood for either “A New Inspiration to Arithmetic” or “A New Inspiration to Accounting”. Goals for the calculators included the creation of circuits to perform the four basic operations and store numbers and the development of a good keyboard and a good numerical output. Solv The company felt troubled by the emergence of commercial computers and brought in Norman Kritz to apply electronic features to their products for simplified use. The <i>MK VII</i> was the first model of the calculator. It had a full keyboard, cold cathode tubes, and a Dekatron. The Dekatron was a tube used for counting that made the keyboard’s decoding circuit easier to maneuver. The keyboard had ten columns of buttons labeled 1-9. The column of numbers in the far-left side were tabulator keys, which were used to move a decimal to a certain place. For example, pressing a tabulator key labeled “5” would move a decimal to the fifth position. The only problems with the MK VII version were that multiplication was complex, and the cathode tubes used in it made the product expensive (about $1000). Then came the <i>MK VIII</i>, which was first released at London’s Business Efficiency Exhibition in the same year. Although it included some of the same parts as the <i>MK VII</i> (like cold catheter tubes), it had some fixes for improvement. In the future, Control Systems Ltd. Would go on to make more desktop calculators like the <i>MK IX and MK X</i> as well as pocket calculators like the <i>Anita 811</i>.
