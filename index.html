    Blaise Pascal is credited with inventing the first actual calculator. While other mathematical devices like abacuses were used to solve for counting and solving basic addition and subtraction, Pascal’s version actually performed calculations. To understand the significance of Pascal’s impact, we must explain his background. Pascal was a French mathematician but also worked with philosophy and physics. He began to work on his <i>Pascaline calculator</i> at only eighteen years old to help his father, who was also a mathematician. <i>Pascal’s calculator</i> had wheels on it to move numbers and calculate the four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Multiplication and division had to be done through adding or subtracting multiple times. To add numbers, the wheels would be moved clockwise, and to subtract, wheels would be moved counterclockwise. The numbers are stored in an accumulator to be processed and then shows up on the display bar. The sautoir, or centerpiece, is what made it possible for the calculator to carry digits. Some downsides, however, include its size, price, and slow speed. Its’ size was large for a calculator: about the size of a shoebox. This made it difficult to transport. It was also expensive to both produce and buy, and as a result, very few were sold. It was time-consuming to solve problems on the calculator as well. <i>Pascal’s invention</i>, built in 1642 was the first of its kind. This prompted other inventors like Leibnez and Leupold to create their own calculators as well, leading to the creations of more and more advanced systems.

            After Pascal’s calculator came the <i> Thomas de Colnar arithmometer</i>, invented by Charles Xavier Thomas de Colmar in 1820. It was the first mechanical calculator and the first of its kind to be mass produced thanks to the Industrial Revolution. This calculator was used until the early 20th century and helped to start the mechanical calculator industry. Colnar created his device to assist himself as an insurance worker. The <i>arithmometer </i> could do more complex calculations than Pascal’s calculator, including division. The earliest version of the <i>arithmometer</i> had a ribbon that was pulled to choose numbers for calculations. This was later replaced by a crank for efficiency. There were also two display windows, one for input (three-digit limit) and another for output (six-digit limit), but this was reduced to just one in the second model. There was a separate gear for multiplication. As for other operations, the second version included a lever to switch from addition to subtraction and from multiplication to division. The display limits also changed with five digits for input and ten digits for output. There were two models made in 1858 and 1878, which had a second counting mechanism to make operations faster and added springs to the setting slides to avoid digits from moving by mistake. <i>The arithmometer</i> cost about 300-500 francs, and could take up an entire desktop, making them both expensive and bulky, however over 5,000 were produced and sold. Thomas de Colnar’s <i>arithmometer</i> replaced human calculators with machines. Before this invention, there were specialized jobs for people to do calculations, all with mental math.

            In 1961, the Bell Punch Company in London created the <i>first electronic desktop calculators</i>: the <i>ANITA MK VII and the ANITA MK VIII</i>. ANITA stood for either “A New Inspiration to Arithmetic” or “A New Inspiration to Accounting”. Goals for the calculators included the creation of circuits to perform the four basic operations and store numbers and the development of a good keyboard and a good numerical output. Solv The company felt troubled by the emergence of commercial computers and brought in Norman Kritz to apply electronic features to their products for simplified use. The <i>MK VII</i> was the first model of the calculator. It had a full keyboard, cold cathode tubes, and a Dekatron. The Dekatron was a tube used for counting that made the keyboard’s decoding circuit easier to maneuver. The keyboard had ten columns of buttons labeled 1-9. The column of numbers in the far-left side were tabulator keys, which were used to move a decimal to a certain place. For example, pressing a tabulator key labeled “5” would move a decimal to the fifth position. The only problems with the MK VII version were that multiplication was complex, and the cathode tubes used in it made the product expensive (about $1000). Then came the <i>MK VIII</i>, which was first released at London’s Business Efficiency Exhibition in the same year. Although it included some of the same parts as the <i>MK VII</i> (like cold catheter tubes), it had some fixes for improvement. In the future, Control Systems Ltd. Would go on to make more desktop calculators like the <i>MK IX and MK X</i> as well as pocket calculators like the <i>Anita 811</i>.

            1985 brought about the creation of the first commercially successful graphic calculator: <i>Casio fx-7000g</i>. Unlike the calculators explained above, this one was handheld and transportable. Not only could they perform calculations but also graph equations on an LCD display screen made of liquid crystal located above fifty keys for imputing numbers and signs. It was powered by a 3x3V cell battery. The calculator had 10-digit precision, meaning its’ answers are sure to be accurate. The<i> Casio fx-7000g</i> could do basic operations but also included logarithms, trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent and their inverses, and roots. There was even a feature called “alpha mode” to put in letters of the alphabet and “shift mode” to access more functions. These other functions were listed in the space under the keys in orange text. The area of the graphing screen was 64 by 96 pixels and could read up to sixteen characters. To this day, some graphing calculators still uses these characteristics. One downside of the <i>fx-7000g</i> is that its memory could not be saved. This was because it used a 422-byte program. After changing out the 3x3V cell batteries, all progress would be lost. When it first came to the market in October of that year, its price was $90.00. This invention led to the development of other graphic calculators like the T1-81, which was released in 1990. The T1-81 used almost identical programming to that of the <i>Casio fx-7000g</i>. The introduction of graphing calculators to lead to even more advancements like calculators with fully-colored screens and smartphone calculators.

            Finally, Casio comes out with the first color graphing calculator in 2010: the <i>Casio Prizm x-CG50</i>. Users can now color-code their graphs and put graphs over fully colored pictures. Colors include black, blue, red, magenta, green, cyan, yellow, and white. These hues show up through LCD displays, which use florescent lamps in the back of the calculator to produce light. 3D technology also allows users to create 3D shapes like cubes and cylinders to find surface areas and volumes. Just like the Casio fx-7000g, it includes a fifty-button keyboard with numbers and signs. Along with this is a main menu that include several features, including spreadsheet-making and conic graphing. On the 216 by 384-pixel graphing screen, users can plot points, make histograms and pie charts for statistics, and integrate equation, along with other functions. Picture Plot on the fx-CG10/20 can lie graphs on top of one of 55 photographs. For example, a student can use a picture of a water fountain to fin the equation of a parabola. The senior sales manager for Casio, Makoto Ori, said that Picture Plot would help users apply their math skills to the real world. The line thickness and style of the graphs can also be changed. User can choose between regular, dashed, or dotted lines and make it thick or thin. Casio Prizm calculators have rechargeable batteries. This also means that the memory of the calculator will not be erased like the Casio fx-7000g’s. The calculator can also be connected to a computer for more storage. Currently, it sells for about $80-$100 in various stores. For the time being, it is the most advanced calculator of its kind.
