    <h1>The Development of Calculators</h1>
    <p>
        The calculator is a device used to perform and graph mathematical equations, and they greatly reduce the time and effort needed for humans to solve equations by hand. Calculators evolved from different counting machines like the abacus and, later, Pascalâ€™s invention of the first actual calculator. They grew to include more complex features and operations. In the span of three centuries, these devices went from being able to only do slow addition and multiplication to being able to answer complex logarithms and integrals with close accuracy. They also began to shrink in size. In the 18th century, calculators took up an entire desktop. In modern times, they can fit in a pocket. Overall, calculators are responsible for many advancements in both math and science. Listed below are five major milestones in the development of calculators, along with their years on creation.
