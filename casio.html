            1985 brought about the creation of the first commercially successful graphic calculator: <i>Casio fx-7000g</i>. Unlike the calculators explained above, this one was handheld and transportable. Not only could they perform calculations but also graph equations on an LCD display screen made of liquid crystal located above fifty keys for imputing numbers and signs. It was powered by a 3x3V cell battery. The calculator had 10-digit precision, meaning its’ answers are sure to be accurate. The<i> Casio fx-7000g</i> could do basic operations but also included logarithms, trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent and their inverses, and roots. There was even a feature called “alpha mode” to put in letters of the alphabet and “shift mode” to access more functions. These other functions were listed in the space under the keys in orange text. The area of the graphing screen was 64 by 96 pixels and could read up to sixteen characters. To this day, some graphing calculators still uses these characteristics. One downside of the <i>fx-7000g</i> is that its memory could not be saved. This was because it used a 422-byte program. After changing out the 3x3V cell batteries, all progress would be lost. When it first came to the market in October of that year, its price was $90.00. This invention led to the development of other graphic calculators like the T1-81, which was released in 1990. The T1-81 used almost identical programming to that of the <i>Casio fx-7000g</i>. The introduction of graphing calculators to lead to even more advancements like calculators with fully-colored screens and smartphone calculators.
